      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Whiskey Soda Ltd. is a creative events company founded in 2025 with one simple idea: to blend the magic of cinema with the craft of cocktails. We design immersive screenings where every film is paired with a bespoke tasting menu of drinks inspired by key moments on screen.</p>

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Born from a passion for storytelling and hospitality, Whiskey Soda began as a project to reimagine the movie-going experience. Instead of popcorn and soda, guests are treated to expertly crafted cocktails that echo the mood, setting, and characters of the film they’re watching.</p>
